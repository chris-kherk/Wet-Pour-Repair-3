                <p>
                    Wetpour repair involves repairing and maintaining rubber Wetpour surfaces using a specialised resin binder to ensure the safety and durability of playgrounds and similar areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Wetpour repair process, the damaged areas of the rubber surface are first assessed and prepared by cleaning and removing any debris or contaminants.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Next, the specialised resin binder is mixed with rubber granules to create a repair mixture that matches the colour and texture of the existing surface. The mixture is then carefully applied to the damaged areas, ensuring a smooth and level finish.</li>
                    <li>This repair method not only restores the surface’s aesthetic appeal but also enhances its longevity and safety features, making it ideal for high-traffic areas like playgrounds and recreational spaces.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Preventative measures such as regular inspections and maintenance can help identify potential problem areas before major repairs are needed.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>

                    The repair complexity is another factor to consider. Simple repairs that involve basic patching are typically more cost-effective compared to intricate fixes that demand specialised techniques or equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The size of the area needing repairs also impacts the costs. Smaller areas can sometimes be repaired more affordably than larger ones, as they require less labor and materials.
